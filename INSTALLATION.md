# A. Installing Linux in Windows

For windows, we need to install Linux in your windows computer. And then install QIIME2 in that Linux.
We will install Linux with *Windows Subsystem for Linux*


# Step 1

On the **Windows menu** (left bottom corner), Right click on **Command Prompt**

You should see **More** option where you shpuld click on **Run as administrator**

System might ask you Yes/No or even your Password (PC password).

Go with **Yes** or provide the password. 

# Step 2

Install wsl using the following command in your **Command Prompt**

```
wsl --install
```

This command may take up to 10 minutes.

Again, system might ask you Yes/No or even your Password (PC password).

Go with **Yes** or provide the password. 

# Step 3

After the code in the **Step 2** concludes. 

Close the **Command Prompt** and **Restart** the computer.

# Step 4 

After the restart, the prompt will ask to create a new linux user.

So, you have to provide a new **username** as well as **password**

This will be your **username** and **password** for linux (ubuntu). 

# Step 5 

Close everything and **Restart** the computer.
